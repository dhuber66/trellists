Trellists: Trello Lists Master


* Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trellists-trello-lists-ma/dgnlcodfeenegnifnpcabcclldoceeml
* Code: https://github.com/VladSavitsky/trellists



Allow to hide and show lists at Trello's boards.
Trello.com is the really great tool but if you have a lot of Lists it will be hard to manage them or you should use horizontal scroll all the time.

This extension solves problem of horizontal scrolling and makes easier management of boards with a huge amount of Lists. Main features:
* Adds a nice bar at the top where all existing Lists are shown;
* Hide and show Lists at board by clicking List name in the bar;
* Status of each List represented by color: grey for hidden List and white for shown.

### Road Map:
* Store also name of board to avoid conflicts for the lists with the same names on different boards.
